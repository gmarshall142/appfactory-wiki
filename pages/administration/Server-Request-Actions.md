# Server Actions Maintenance

Server actions allow the configuration of actions that will be taken when making calls to the server to update data.  
Simple examples are writing to a log or history table when updating an issue or request or sending an email notification.

NOTE: The current page actions are configured using knowledge of Javascript and will need to be refined to allow 
non-programmers to configure the actions.

NOTE: The JSON can be formatted to making editing easier.  The JSON structure is checked when clicking the 'REFORMAT'
button or clicking SUBMIT.

# Page Maintenance

Application pages are created using this screen.  Currently pages contain a single form and map directly to the 
application’s menu choices.  A page is created and then added to the menu tree by clicking the ‘>’ icon.  Once a menu 
item is added to the menu tree it can be positioned and edited in the menu tree.  It is necessary to Save the changes 
to the menu.

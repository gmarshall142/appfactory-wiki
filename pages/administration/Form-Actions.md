# Form Actions Maintenance

Form actions allow the configuration of actions that will be taken when events occur while interacting with a form.  
Simple examples are navigating to different page after successful submission of a record or loading data when opening a 
page.

NOTE: The current page actions are configured using knowledge of Javascript and will need to be refined to allow 
non-programmers to configure the actions.

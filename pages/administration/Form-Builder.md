# Form Builder

Application forms are built in the ‘Form Builder’  page using the form.io form builder interface.  The user can select 
the application page and specify a table whose data the form represents.  Forms are built by dragging layout or control 
components from the left side of the page onto the form.  Each field can then have a resource and/or table column 
associated with it.  The resources are loaded onto a loaded form at runtime and after submission the table column will 
be updated with the data from the form.

NOTE: Currently only one form can be added to a page.

# Resource Maintenance

Select boxes in forms are populated by application resources which are basically references to lookup tables.  
References are created by selecting an application table and specifying the column in the table that will be used as the
 text in the select control.  Currently only the Users in the system have ‘Special Processing’ which represents special 
 scripting in the database to support that table.
